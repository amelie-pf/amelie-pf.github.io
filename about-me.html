                <p> Currently, I am studying Mobile Media at the Stuttgart Media University. 
                    The focus of my studies is mainly on UI / UX, because I would like to work in this field after I gratuated. 
                    I really enjoy being creative, especially when it comes to solving problems with good and intuitive design and creating simple things.</p> <br>
                
                <p> Additionally, in my studies I have learned the basics in software development, web development and app development. 
                    Understand the technical side and background of a good design is essential for me.</p> <br>
                    
                <p>I spend a lot of time in nature with friends, especially at lakes or by the water or travelling because I am very curious about new cultures and places, which I find insanely inspiring and I develop a lot of creative ideas.
