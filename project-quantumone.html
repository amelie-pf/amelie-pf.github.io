                <p>
                    Throughout the project, we regularly pitched our progress to our instructor and the class.
                    The whole project followed the Iterative Design Process, which involved constantly reanalyzing and reevaluating our designs to improve them. 
                    At the beginning of the course, we established specific milestones to get accustomed to working under time pressure and meeting deadlines. 
                    We held regular group meetings to collaborate on the project and delegate tasks to ensure each team member could work independently as well

                <p>
                    During the brainstorming phase, our team engaged in a dynamic design thinking workshop. 
                    We began by creating a persona and an empathy map to better understand our target audience. 
                    Next, we developed "as-is" scenarios and applied scenario mapping to identify key pain points, including how to keep users motivated in the long term and how to present complex content in a simple, understandable manner. 
                    We tackled these challenges by generating innovative solutions through Big Idea Vignettes. 
                    To further boost our creative output, we utilized the Crazy 8 technique to generate a multitude of ideas for the visual implementation of our project.

                    <p>
                        During our design thinking workshop, we created personas to gain a clear understanding of our target audience and design with their needs in mind. 
                        We considered factors like age, education level, and interests to create different personas that represented potential users. 
                        This approach helped us to view the app from different perspectives and tailor our design accordingly.
                        Our ultimate goal was to create an app that would be intuitive and engaging for all target users, especially children and teenagers who will use it primarily on smartphones.
                        We also took into account the need for usability in noisy and mobile environments like public transportation, and the requirement for adaptable knowledge levels to cater to different user types.

                    <p>
                        In the early stages of our project, we focused on developing a content strategy that would engage our target audience of children and teenagers. 
                        We then created an information architecture to ensure that our app was structured in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
                        We started with a low fidelity prototype using Figma, which allowed us to quickly iterate and make changes based on feedback.
                        To evaluate the effectiveness of our design decisions, we created an evaluation strategy that incorporated qualitative research methods.
                        We performed shadowing with potential users and analyzed the outcomes.
                        From this evaluation, we found that the map and navigation through the app on the first page was not self-explanatory enough, and decided that onboarding may be necessary.
                        <br>
                        Based on these findings, we developed an interactive wireframe prototype using Figma and implemented the necessary changes, such as redesigning the map with more clarity, adding color and icons, and including additional navigation icons.

                    <p>
                        Creating a scalable design system is an essential part of any design process, and we recognized its importance in our project. 
                        With this in mind, we developed a comprehensive design system that included Typography, Color, Spacing, Components, Icons, and Illustrations using Figma. 
                        This allowed us to establish a consistent visual language that could be applied across all design elements, ensuring a cohesive and unified user experience.

                    <p class="project-section-heading">Final Steps</p>

                    <p>
                        After developing the scalable design system, we used it to design the visual screens of the app. 
                        We applied the typography, color, spacing, components, icons, and illustrations consistently across the screens to create a cohesive and visually appealing interface.
                        We also added animation to the wireframes to enhance the user experience and make the app more engaging.
                        Additionally, we designed the onboarding process to provide a short introduction to the topic, explain the navigation and functions such as profile settings, and ensure that the app was easy to use even for new users.
                        <br>
                        To finalize the project, we made the prototype interactive, allowing users to experience the app's functionalities and provide feedback.
                        We incorporated the feedback from the evaluation into the final design, such as redesigning the map with more clarity and adding more navigation icons.
                        Finally, we created a high fidelity prototype that accurately reflected the app's design, features, and user experience.
                        With the scalable design system, consistent visual design, animation, onboarding, and a high fidelity prototype, we were confident in our final product and ready to present it to our instructor and class.
