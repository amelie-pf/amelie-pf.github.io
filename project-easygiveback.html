                    The interdisciplinary project involved around 20 students from different courses of study of Hochschule der Medien. The team was divided into different departments (Design, Development, Public Relations, Social Media and SEO). <br>
                    For this project, I worked as UI/UX designer in the Design Team which included wireframing, prototyping in Figma and user testing. The overall goal was to develop a functional donation platform in an interdisciplinary team to donate to non-profit organizations. <br>    
                </p>

                        In weekly sprints, weekly goals were planned for each department via Jira software. All tasks were collected, and the workload was estimated so that each team member had approximately the same amount of work. In addition, changes were discussed and new ideas were decided as a whole team in the weekly meetings. The design team additionally met weekly to discuss issues and work on set goals. <br>

                        We redesigned the home page, the filter page, organization pages and the payment page. There were made changes in navigation, functionality and design. <br>
                        Designs were created for desktop, tablet and smartphone.

                        In addition to the already existing pages, we have designed a contact page, an about us page and FAQs. <br>
                        At the end of the semester, the go live was scheduled, which took place simultaneously at a project fair at the university and went perfect without any severe problems. About 20 non-profit organizations were working with us at the time of the go live.
