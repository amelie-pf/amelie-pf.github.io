                <p>
                    The interdisciplinary project involved around 20 students from different courses of study of Media University Stuttgart, Germany. The team was divided into different departments (for example Design, Development, Public Relations, Social Media and SEO). <br>
                    For this project, I worked as an UI/UX designer in the Design Team which included wireframing, prototyping in Figma and user testing. The overall goal was to develop a functional donation platform in an interdisciplinary team which allows users to donate to non-profit organizations. <br>    
                </p>

                <p>
                    In weekly sprints, weekly goals were planned for each department via Jira software. All tasks were collected, and the workload was estimated so that each team member had approximately the same amount of work. In addition, changes were discussed and new ideas were decided as a whole team in the weekly meetings. The design team additionally met weekly to discuss issues and work on set goals. <br>

                        During the semester, I worked on the Analyzing the first version of the website, overall revision of the existing design, User Testing, determine responsive structure and wireframing. After conducting user testing and analyzing their results we adjusted the color tones and created a design system so that consistency can be ensured despite five designers.                     </p>

                    <p>
                        We redesigned the home page, the filter page, organization pages and the payment page. There were made changes in navigation, functionality and design. <br>
                        Designs were created for desktop, tablet and smartphone.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the already existing pages, we have designed a contact page, an about us page to provide an easy way to communicate with us and to get to know us and FAQs for further information. <br>
                        At the end of the semester, the go live was scheduled, which took place simultaneously at a project fair at the university and went perfect without any severe problems. About 20 non-profit organizations were working with us at the time of the go live.
                        This project was not only a project for our university but a matter of heart for all of us. And even after this semester wes still work on the project to make sure to provide the best service.
