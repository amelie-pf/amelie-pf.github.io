                <p>
                    Treye Tech is a German IT-start-up specialized in design, development, and implementation of solutions for hands-free operation of mobile devices. Smartphones and tablets are usually operated using touch gestures. 
                    However, for people with disabilities, such as quadriplegia, touch operation can become a challenge, if not an insurmountable hurdle.
                    To overcome this barrier, Treye Tech in collaboration with Hochschule der Medien are developing a gaze-based 4-way control to make apps operable again with help of a special overlay menu.
                    This project was conducted in the class "Usability Engineering", where I had the opportunity to work on this project with two of my classmates throughout the semester.
                    Through this project, we gained valuable insights into the usability engineering process and the importance of designing inclusive solutions that cater to the diverse needs of users.

                    <p>
                        During the user testing phase, we utilized a Samsung Galaxy Tab A and a tripod provided by the Hochschule der Medien to test the Treye Tech-developed "Gallery App."
                        In preparation for the testing, we familiarized ourselves with the hardware and software, including the tablet settings and the three camera-based switch accesses by Android.
                        With the guidance of our instructor, we brainstormed possible use cases for the testing and agreed on five specific tasks to be performed by the subjects, including selecting and navigating through images, zooming in and out, and favoriting an image.
                        To ensure balanced results, we applied the technique of "counterbalancing" by having subjects alternate between two navigation methods.

                    <p>
                        The study was designed using a between-subjects study design, which involved dividing the 15 participants into three groups.
                        Each group tested one of the three scanning methods from Android and Treye Tech's gaze-based navigation, enabling a comparison between these groups.
                        The 15 participants were recruited through verbal and written arrangements in a private environment, and the user tests were conducted over three days in the buildings of Hochschule der Medien, with one hour scheduled per test.
                        During this time, participants completed various tasks, including reading and signing necessary documents, completing questionnaires about age, gender, and visual impairment and experience, becoming familiar with the control methods, executing use cases, and completing the Task Load Index (TLX) and a final interview to gain further insight into their experience with the input methods. 
                        To ensure accurate results, we took great care to ensure that the user tests took place in the same environmental conditions.

                    <p>
                        Upon thorough analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data, we found that Treye Tech's four-way control exhibited better results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency than Android's camera-based switch access. Specifically, the four-way control demonstrated faster and more effective navigation than the camera-based switch access, as revealed by our hypothesis testing and T-tests.
                        Moreover, the workload of using Treye Tech's four-way control was rated significantly lower on average than Android's camera-based switch access, as indicated by the Task Load Index (TLX).
                        These findings highlight the potential benefits of Treye Tech's innovative solution for hands-free operation of mobile devices, especially for individuals with disabilities who may face significant challenges using traditional touch-based interfaces.
                        By improving accessibility and ease of use, Treye Tech's technology has the potential to greatly enhance the user experience of mobile devices for a broader range of individuals.
