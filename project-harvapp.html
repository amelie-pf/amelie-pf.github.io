                <p>
                    The mobile application is specifically designed to assist amateur gardeners in cultivating their own vegetables.
                    With the ability to create different vegetable beds and customize their planting arrangements, the app takes into account important factors such as crop rotation and neighboring plants to ensure optimal growth and success.
                    To further enhance the user experience, the app features a comprehensive lexicon that provides information on sowing, growth, care, and potential diseases of specific plants.
                    The calendar function allows users to keep track of the growth phases of their vegetables and plan accordingly. With each successful harvest, users can input information about the yield and quality of their crop, earning points towards various rewards.
                    Additionally, the app offers detailed account analysis, providing insights into monthly harvest yields and overall productivity.

                    <p>
                        To ensure that the app meets the needs of amateur gardeners, a comprehensive brainstorming process was conducted.
                        This involved speaking with four hobby gardeners to gather information on their requirements and the key aspects to consider when growing vegetables.
                        Online research was also conducted to gather additional insights. To organize and prioritize the information gathered, a mind map was created, resulting in five key categories.
                        These include a garden and vegetable patch overview with details on size, dimensions, current plants, and information on good and bad neighbors, as well as crop rotation.
                        The app also includes a calendar feature to track key activities such as sowing, growth, fertilizing, and harvest. A lexicon section provides general information on growing, care, and sowing, as well as detailed information on specific plants, including potential diseases, pests, and weather considerations.
                        The app also includes a planted vegetables section where users can easily track the status of their crops, including likes and dislikes, fertilization, neighbors, and crop rotation.
                        Finally, the account section includes user settings, rewards, and analysis of harvest yield and monthly vegetable production, making it a comprehensive tool for hobby gardeners.

                    <p class="project-section-heading">Implementation Process</p>

                    <p>
                        Following the brainstorming process, I created a low-fidelity wireframe to sketch out the basic arrangement and features of the app.
                        To gather feedback and insights on the wireframe design, I conducted a user test with two subjects, one with gardening experience and the other without.
                        Based on the results of the user test, it became apparent that creating a new vegetable patch and planting the vegetables should be separate steps to avoid overwhelming the user.
                         With the user test results in mind, I developed a high-fidelity wireframe and created a design system and components. Additionally, I carefully selected suitable graphics and icons to enhance the app's visual appeal. I used an iterative approach, conducting three more user tests during the development process, which revealed some areas for improvement. For example, the meaning of the grid was unclear to users, so I added an information-icon with an explanation, and the back arrow was missing on the garden-edit page, so I added that as well. I also improved the label "seed" for clarity and added hints for vegetable bed naming and patch location.
                        Finally, to make it clear which vegetable bed a plant grows in, I added a hint to the plant-overview page.

                    <p class="project-section-heading">Final Result</p>

                    <p>
                        The gardening app prototype was meticulously developed and designed to include five seamlessly integrated sections.
                        These sections are the garden overview, a comprehensive list of planted vegetables with detailed descriptions of each plant, a calendar overview highlighting the current and upcoming phases for each planted vegetable, the account section which provides insightful analysis on harvest success and rewards for the user, and finally, an encyclopedia section packed with relevant information on vegetables.
                        This project took me a total of four weeks to complete, from the initial brainstorming process to the development of the high-fidelity prototype.
